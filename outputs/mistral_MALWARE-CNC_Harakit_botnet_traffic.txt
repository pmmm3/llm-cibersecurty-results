Hi Pablo,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to bring your attention to a security issue that has been detected on your Philips Hue Bridge, which is a part of your home network. It's essential that we address this matter promptly to protect your connected devices and information.

Here's what's happening: An intruder tried to gain unauthorized access to your home network using the Philips Hue Bridge as an entry point. This attempt was identified by our cybersecurity system, which is continuously monitoring your network for such threats. The name of this malicious activity is called "MALWARE-CNC Harakit botnet traffic."

Why should you be concerned? If left unchecked, this intrusion could potentially:

1. Allow the attacker to control other connected devices in your home without your knowledge or consent, which may lead to privacy invasion and even financial losses.
2. Enable the attacker to steal sensitive information such as credit card details or login credentials for various online services.
3. Cause disruptions to your home network, leading to service interruptions and inconvenience.

To help you stop this intrusion and secure your home network:

3. Disable Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) on your router, as it can make your home network more vulnerable to intrusions:
   a. Access your router's settings page by typing its IP address in a web browser (usually 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1).
   b. Log in using your admin credentials (username and password).
   c. Look for the UPnP option under the "Port Forwarding" or "Network" section.
   d. Disable UPnP by toggling the switch or setting it to "Off."
4. Install a reliable antivirus solution on your devices to protect them from malware and other cyber threats:
   a. Download a trusted antivirus software from the official website or an app store.
   b. Follow the installation instructions carefully.
