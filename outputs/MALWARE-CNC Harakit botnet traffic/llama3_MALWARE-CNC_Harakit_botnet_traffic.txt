**URGENT WARNING**

Dear Pablo,

I'm writing to inform you that our home network has detected a suspicious activity that could compromise your safety and privacy. Our system has flagged a malware botnet traffic alert, which means someone or something is trying to hack into our Smart Home devices.

If we don't take action immediately, this unauthorized access could:

* Allow hackers to control our smart devices, potentially causing harm or disrupting our daily routines
* Compromise your personal data and online security
* Put you and your family at risk of identity theft or other cybercrimes

To stop this intrusion, please follow these simple steps:

1. **Restart the Philips Hue Bridge**: This will disconnect any unauthorized devices connected to your smart home system.
2. **Change your Wi-Fi password**: A new, strong password will prevent further unauthorized access.
3. **Update your Smart Home device firmware**: Make sure all your devices are running the latest software to patch any known vulnerabilities.
4. **Run a virus scan on your router and devices**: This will help detect and remove any malware that may have been installed.
5. **Contact our IT support team**: We'll work with you to ensure our network is secure and provide guidance on how to maintain good cyber hygiene.

Please take these steps as soon as possible to protect your home, family, and personal data. If you need assistance or have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out.

Stay safe online!
