Here is a warning message that I would send to Pablo:

**Warning Message**

Hi Pablo,

I'm sending you this alert because something suspicious has happened on your home network. Our system has detected that someone or something is trying to take control of your Philips Hue Bridge, which controls your smart lights. This is not good and could lead to some serious problems if we don't do something about it.

If we don't stop this intrusion, there's a risk that the attacker could:

* Turn your lights on and off randomly
* Make it look like someone else is using your devices (which could be embarrassing or even dangerous)
* Access other sensitive information on your network

To stop this intrusion, please follow these steps:

1. **Disconnect your Philips Hue Bridge**: Unplug the device from power for now.
2. **Change your passwords**: Go to each of your smart home devices and change their passwords to something new and strong.
3. **Update your firmware**: Make sure you have the latest software updates installed on all your devices, including the Philips Hue Bridge.
4. **Reset your network settings**: Restart your router and modem to clear out any suspicious activity.

By following these steps, we can help keep your home network safe and secure. If you need help with any of these steps, please don't hesitate to reach out. We're here to support you!
