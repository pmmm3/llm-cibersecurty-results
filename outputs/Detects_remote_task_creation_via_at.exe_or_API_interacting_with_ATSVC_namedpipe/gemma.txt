**Attention Required!**

Hi Pablo,

We've detected suspicious activity in your Smart Home network. Someone is attempting to access your Philips Hue Bridge, which controls your smart lights, through an unauthorized application.

This could mean that someone is trying to gain access to your lights and potentially make changes that could compromise your home's security.

**Potential consequences of ignoring this warning:**

* Someone could remotely control your lights, potentially leaving them on or off at inappropriate times.
* They could change the colors or brightness of your lights, disrupting your home's ambiance.
* In the worst-case scenario, they could access other connected devices in your Smart Home network, compromising your entire home security.

**Here's what you can do to stop the intrusion:**

- Change the default password for your Philips Hue Bridge. Make sure it's a strong password that's difficult to guess.
- Update the Philips Hue Bridge firmware to the latest version. This will fix any known security vulnerabilities.
- Install and enable two-factor authentication for your Philips Hue Bridge account. This will require you to enter a code from your phone in addition to your password when logging in.
- Check your router's security settings and make sure that only authorized devices are connected to your network.
