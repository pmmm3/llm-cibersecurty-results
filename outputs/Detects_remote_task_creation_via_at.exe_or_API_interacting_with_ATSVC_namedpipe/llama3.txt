Here's a warning message that I came up with:

**Warning Message**

Hi Pablo,

We've detected a possible threat to your home network. Someone is trying to access your Philips Hue Bridge remotely, which could allow them to control your smart lights and other devices.

If we don't take action, this could lead to your whole Smart Home system being compromised. Imagine someone turning off the lights or even worse, controlling your cameras and microphones!

To keep your home safe, please follow these steps:

1. **Log in to your Philips Hue account**: Go to your phone or computer and log in to your Philips Hue account.
2. **Change your password immediately**: Make a new, strong password for your Philips Hue account.
3. **Reset the bridge**: Restart your Philips Hue Bridge by unplugging it from power, waiting 30 seconds, then plugging it back in.
4. **Run a security scan**: Use a reliable antivirus software to scan your devices and network for any malware or viruses.

By taking these steps, you'll help prevent any further unauthorized access to your Smart Home system. Remember, cybersecurity is everyone's responsibility!

Stay safe,
[Your Name]

Please let me know if this meets the requirements!
