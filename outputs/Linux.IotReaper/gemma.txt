**Subject: Urgent Security Alert - Philips Hue Bridge compromised!**

Hey Pablo! 🚨

There's been an unauthorized access attempt to your Philips Hue Bridge, which controls all your connected lights. Someone is trying to gain control of your smart home! 💡

This could mean they could:

* Dim or brighten your lights at odd hours. 💡
* Turn your lights on/off at unexpected times. 🏠
* Use your lights to spy on you or eavesdrop on your conversations. 👂

**Here's what you need to do right away to secure your smart home:**

* **Change the default password** for your Philips Hue Bridge immediately. It's likely the attacker already knows it. Use a strong and unique password that's at least 12 characters long and includes a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols. 🔑
* **Update your Philips Hue Bridge firmware** to the latest version. This fixes known security vulnerabilities. 💻
* **Consider temporarily disconnecting** your Philips Hue Bridge from your network until you've taken these steps. 🔌
* **Review your other smart home devices** for any suspicious activity. Change their passwords too if needed. 🕵️‍♀️
* **Keep your smart home software and devices up to date** with the latest security patches. 🛡️
