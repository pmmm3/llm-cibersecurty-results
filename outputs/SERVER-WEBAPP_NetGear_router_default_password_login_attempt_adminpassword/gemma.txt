**Warning Message:**

Hey Pablo! ðŸš¨

There's been a security breach in your home network! Someone just tried to access your router using the default username and password. ðŸ˜±

This could mean someone is trying to control your smart home devices and could lead to:

* Someone changing your network settings and cutting you off from the internet
* Sensitive information like your passwords being stolen
* Your smart home devices being controlled without your permission

**Here's what you need to do to keep your home safe:**

1. Change the router's default username and password immediately. Use a strong password that's at least 12 characters long and includes a mix of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
2. Check your router's settings to see if there's an option to enable two-factor authentication. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a code from your phone in addition to your password.
3. Update your Philips Hue Bridge to the latest version. This will fix any security vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.
4. Make sure all your smart home devices are up-to-date with the latest firmware.
5. Keep your router's firewall enabled. This will help block unauthorized access to your network.
