**Attention Required! Security Alert**

Hi Pablo! 

We've detected unusual activity on your Philips Hue Bridge, which controls your smart lights. This could be someone trying to access your network without permission. 

**Here's what happened:**

Someone has sent an alert indicating suspicious activity involving chunked transfer-encoding, which is a technique often used in cyberattacks. 

**Why is this a concern?**

If left unchecked, this unauthorized access could:

- Allow someone to control your smart lights, potentially disrupting your home's lighting.
- Expose other connected devices in your network to potential compromise.

**What to do:**

1. **Change your Philips Hue Bridge password immediately.** Choose a strong password that is at least 12 characters long and includes a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
2. **Update your Philips Hue Bridge to the latest firmware version.** Manufacturers often release security patches to fix vulnerabilities.
3. **Isolate the Philips Hue Bridge from other devices on your network.** This reduces the risk of the attack spreading to other connected devices.
4. **Consider adding additional security measures** such as enabling two-factor authentication for your Philips Hue Bridge account.

**Please take action as soon as possible to prevent further security risks.**
