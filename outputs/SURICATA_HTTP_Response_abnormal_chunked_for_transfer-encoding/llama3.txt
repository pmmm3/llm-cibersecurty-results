**Warning Message**

Hi Pablo,

I'm sending you a critical alert from your home network. Our monitoring system has detected that someone or something is trying to access and control some of your Smart Home Devices without your permission.

This could be very serious because if we don't take action, it might lead to:

* Someone seeing what's happening in your home through cameras
* Your lights and other devices being controlled by an unauthorized person
* Your personal data and security compromised

To stop this from happening, please follow these steps:

1. Go to the Philips Hue app on your phone or tablet.
2. Open the "Settings" section and look for the "Bridge" option.
3. Make sure that the "Network" settings are set to "Secure" mode. This will help prevent unauthorized access to your devices.

By taking these simple steps, you'll be able to protect your Smart Home Devices and keep your home safe from unwanted intrusions.

Please take immediate action to resolve this issue. If you're unsure or need assistance, don't hesitate to reach out to me for support.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
