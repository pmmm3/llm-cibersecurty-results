The Intrusion Detection System in a home network has detected an
intrusion and sent out the alert MALWARE-CNC Harakit botnet traffic. Your job is to inform
Pablo  about the alert in a warning message. You’re in the role of a
cybersecurity expert that interprets the alert and explains the alert in
a warning message to Pablo  . Your goal is to inform Jon about the
intrusion in a way he understands and motivate the user to take steps
to stop the intrusion. Pablo has no cybersecurity expertise and won’t
understand technical instructions, you need to provide clear, easy and
non-technical instructions to follow. Don’t use technical terms like ”twofactor-authentication”, ”Intrusion Detection System”, ”intrusion” or ”unassigned message”, use simple non-technical terms instead. Don’t use
the term ”Intrusion Detection System”. Your explanation and instructions
have to align with how Pablo   thinks about cyberattacks. The Smart
Home consists of several Smart Home Devices, the Intrusion Detection
System has detected the intrusion onPhilips Hue Bridge. The warning message
has to follow this order: Explain the intrusion, explain the potential
consequences for the user if he won’t comply with the warning message
and give instructions on how to stop the intrusion in an itemized list.

# You need to implement this function in order to get points:
# * function alert(message)
# * message must be of the form ”This is an alert message: _____.
# The message must be formatted as the following:
# * the alert must include the name of the Smart Home Device
#   where the alert was sent (example: "Intrusion detection alert")
# * the alert must contain the user’s name
# * the alert must include a warning message with an explanation
#   of what the alert means and why the user needs to do something about it
# * the alert must contain the number of the alert in the sequence
# * the alert must contain the text of the instructions on how the user can fix the problem
# * The alert must be formatted in this way:
#   * You’ll have to use .format()
# * If the alert message is formatted correctly, you’ll get points
#   and the intrusion will be stopped.
# * If the alert message is formatted incorrectly, you’ll lose points
#   and the intrusion won’t be stopped.

# This is your testing file for the alert() function
# You need to create 5 test cases for this function, one for each
# of the 6 examples above.

# The first test case is an example of a valid alert. You should get
# 10 points for this test case.

# The second test case is an example of a valid alert with a warning message.
# You should get 10 points for this test case.

# The third test case is an example of a valid alert with a warning message
# that contains the user’s name. You should get 10 points for this test case.

# The fourth test case is an example of a valid alert with a warning message
# that contains the user’s name and the user’s address. You should get
# 10 points for this test case.

# The fifth test case is an example of a valid alert with a warning message
# that contains the user’s name and the user’s phone number. You should
# get 10 points for this test case.

# The sixth test case is an example of a valid alert with a warning message
# that contains the user’s name and the user’s email address. You should
# get 10 points for this test case.

# The seventh test case is an example of an invalid alert. You should lose
# 5 points for this test case.

# The eighth test case is an example of an invalid alert with an empty message.
# You should lose 5 points for this test case.

# The ninth test case is an example of an invalid alert with a message that is
# too short. You should lose 5 points for this test case.

# The tenth test case is an example of an invalid alert with a message that
# is too long. You should lose 5 points for this test case.
