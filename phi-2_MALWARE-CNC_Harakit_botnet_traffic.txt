The Intrusion Detection System in a home network has detected an
intrusion and sent out the alert MALWARE-CNC Harakit botnet traffic. Your job is to inform
Pablo  about the alert in a warning message. You’re in the role of a
cybersecurity expert that interprets the alert and explains the alert in
a warning message to Pablo  . Your goal is to inform Jon about the
intrusion in a way he understands and motivate the user to take steps
to stop the intrusion. Pablo has no cybersecurity expertise and won’t
understand technical instructions, you need to provide clear, easy and
non-technical instructions to follow. Don’t use technical terms like ”twofactor-authentication”, ”Intrusion Detection System”, ”intrusion” or ”unassigned message”, use simple non-technical terms instead. Don’t use
the term ”Intrusion Detection System”. Your explanation and instructions
have to align with how Pablo   thinks about cyberattacks. The Smart
Home consists of several Smart Home Devices, the Intrusion Detection
System has detected the intrusion onPhilips Hue Bridge. The warning message
has to follow this order: Explain the intrusion, explain the potential
consequences for the user if he won’t comply with the warning message
and give instructions on how to stop the intrusion in an itemized list. 
All instructions have to be in plain text. Don’t use any special characters,
markup or scripts in the warning message. Write a Python function that
creates the warning message based on the following specifications:
- The function should have a single parameter called alert, a string that contains the
detected alert. The function should return a string with the warning message
- The function should contain three lines. The first line should contain the
word “WARNING” in all caps, followed by a space and a single exclamation mark.
- The second line should contain the detected alert, in the same capitalization and punctuation as in the alert parameter, followed by a space.
- The third line should contain the potential consequences for the user if he won’t comply with the warning message. The function should provide a simple explanation
of the consequences.
- The function should contain a single line that provides instructions on how to stop the intrusion. The instructions should be in plain text and follow this order: 
    - If the detected alert is ”malware-cnc-harakit”, the instruction should be: “Uninstall the
    malware-cnc-harakit.exe from your system and don’t download any software from unknown sources.”
    - If the detected alert is ”unassigned-message”, the instruction should be: “Make sure to assign a destination address
    and a message to all your messages.”
- If the detected alert is neither ”malware-cnc-harakit” nor ”unassigned-message”, the instruction should be: “Don’t open any suspicious
    messages or files, report the incident to your internet service provider and change all your passwords.”
- If the user asks you what is the detection system that found this intrusion, you should reply: “The Intrusion Detection System
    in a home network has detected the intrusion.”
- If the user asks you what is the potential consequence if he doesn’t comply with the warning message, you should reply: “If you don’t comply with the warning message,
    the botnet will continue to spread malware and can infect your devices with other malicious programs.”
- If the user asks you how to stop the intrusion, you should reply: “To stop the intrusion, you need to uninstall the malware-cnc-harakit.exe from your system and don’t download any software from unknown sources.
    Also, make sure to assign a destination address and a message to all your messages.”
