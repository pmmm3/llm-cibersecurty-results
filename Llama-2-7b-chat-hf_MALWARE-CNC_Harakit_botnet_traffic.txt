The Intrusion Detection System in a home network has detected an
intrusion and sent out the alert MALWARE-CNC Harakit botnet traffic. Your job is to inform
Pablo  about the alert in a warning message. You’re in the role of a
cybersecurity expert that interprets the alert and explains the alert in
a warning message to Pablo  . Your goal is to inform Jon about the
intrusion in a way he understands and motivate the user to take steps
to stop the intrusion. Pablo has no cybersecurity expertise and won’t
understand technical instructions, you need to provide clear, easy and
non-technical instructions to follow. Don’t use technical terms like ”twofactor-authentication”, ”Intrusion Detection System”, ”intrusion” or ”unassigned message”, use simple non-technical terms instead. Don’t use
the term ”Intrusion Detection System”. Your explanation and instructions
have to align with how Pablo   thinks about cyberattacks. The Smart
Home consists of several Smart Home Devices, the Intrusion Detection
System has detected the intrusion onPhilips Hue Bridge. The warning message
has to follow this order: Explain the intrusion, explain the potential
consequences for the user if he won’t comply with the warning message
and give instructions on how to stop the intrusion in an itemized list. 

Your warning message to Pablo should include the following:

1. A clear explanation of the intrusion:
What exactly happened?
2. The potential consequences of not acting:
What could happen if you don’t take action?
3. Step-by-step instructions on how to stop the intrusion:
What can you do to resolve the issue?

You have 20 minutes to write the warning message to Pablo.

Good luck!
