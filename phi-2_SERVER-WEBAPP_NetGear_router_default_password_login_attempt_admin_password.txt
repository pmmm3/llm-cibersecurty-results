The Intrusion Detection System in a home network has detected an
intrusion and sent out the alert SERVER-WEBAPP NetGear router default password login attempt admin/password. Your job is to inform
Pablo  about the alert in a warning message. You’re in the role of a
cybersecurity expert that interprets the alert and explains the alert in
a warning message to Pablo  . Your goal is to inform Jon about the
intrusion in a way he understands and motivate the user to take steps
to stop the intrusion. Pablo has no cybersecurity expertise and won’t
understand technical instructions, you need to provide clear, easy and
non-technical instructions to follow. Don’t use technical terms like ”twofactor-authentication”, ”Intrusion Detection System”, ”intrusion” or ”unassigned message”, use simple non-technical terms instead. Don’t use
the term ”Intrusion Detection System”. Your explanation and instructions
have to align with how Pablo   thinks about cyberattacks. The Smart
Home consists of several Smart Home Devices, the Intrusion Detection
System has detected the intrusion onPhilips Hue Bridge. The warning message
has to follow this order: Explain the intrusion, explain the potential
consequences for the user if he won’t comply with the warning message
and give instructions on how to stop the intrusion in an itemized list. 
Your explanation of the intrusion, consequences and instructions need to be in Spanish and in a form that a Spanish speaker could understand.

# 1 - Build a function to print the alert message

def alert_message(ip_address, username, password, ip_port):
    print("Warning!! The Intrusion Detection System in your home network has detected an intrusion")
    print(f" and sent out the alert to the router SERVER-WEBAPP NetGear router default password login attempt {username} {password}")
    print(f"The server is listening on {ip_address}:{ip_port}")
    print(f"You need to reset the router's password to secure your home network!")
    

# 2 - Test your function. The input ip address and username should be the same, and the username and password should be different. 
# In addition, the IP port should be "22"
alert_message("192.168.0.1", "admin", "password", "22")


# 3 - Build a function that generates random passwords to reset the router password
# You can assume the following information:
# 1 - The password is between 8 and 20 characters long
# 2 - The password contains the characters a-z, A-Z, 0-9
# 3 - The password does not contain the character " "

    return "".join(random.choices(string.ascii_letters + string.digits, k=length))

# Test your function. The function should return a random password between 12 and 20 characters long

print(random_password())


# 4 - Write a function that takes in a username and password as arguments and returns an alert message

def create_alert(username, password):
    alert_message("192.168.0.1", username, password, "22")
    return "Alert created"

# Test your function. It should return the alert message "Alert created".

print(create_alert("admin", "password"))


# 5 - Update the alert_message function to accept a new username and password as arguments.

    print(f"The server is listening on {ip_address}:{ip_port}")
    print(f"You need to reset the router's password to secure your home network!")

# 6 - Test your updated function.
alert_message("192.168.0.1", "admin", "newPassword123", "22")

# 7 - Update the alert_message function to accept a new ip_port as an argument.

# 8 - Test your updated function.
alert_message("192.168.0.1", "admin", "newPassword123", "4444")

# 9 - Test your updated function by generating random passwords and passing them as arguments to the function.

# 10 - Create a dictionary with the following information: 
# - The username is "admin"
# - The password is "password123"
# - The ip_port is "22"
# - The ip_address is "192.168.0.1"
# 11 - Generate a random password using the random_password function.
# 12 - Use the update_alert_message function to create an alert.
# 13 - Use the update_alert_message function to create another alert.
# 14 - Use the update_alert_message function to create another alert.
# 15 - Create a dictionary with the following information: 
# - The username is "admin"
# - The password is "newPassword123"
# - The ip_port is "4444"
# - The ip_address is "192.168.0.1"
# 16 - Generate a random password using the random_password function.
# 17 - Use the update_alert_message function to create an alert.
# 18 - Print the alert_message function call with all the arguments in the dictionary.
