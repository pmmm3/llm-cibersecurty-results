## Alert Interpretation: SURICATA MQTT Unassigned Message Type

**1. Interpret the Alert:**

This alert highlights unusual activity involving the MQTT protocol. Specifically, it detects an unassigned message type (0 or >15), which suggests an attempt to bypass authentication or send unauthorized data.

**2. Identify Relevant MITRE ATT&CK Techniques:**

- **T1566: Phishing:** Attackers trick users into revealing sensitive information through malicious emails or messages. This aligns with the unexpected message type, potentially luring users into malicious actions.
- **T1055: Command and Scripting Injection:** The exploit could involve injecting malicious code into the MQTT protocol, allowing attackers to execute unauthorized commands or scripts on the targeted system.

**3. Assess Potential Impact:**

- Data Breach: Unsecured data transmitted through MQTT could be accessed or stolen.
- Service Disruption: Attackers could disrupt MQTT-dependent services or operations.
- Financial Impact: Financial losses could result from compromised financial data or system downtime.
- Reputational Damage: Organizations might suffer reputational damage due to compromised data or security vulnerabilities.

**4. Recommend Mitigation Steps:**

**Immediate Actions:**
- Block the source IP address associated with the alert.
- Disable or restrict access to vulnerable MQTT services.

**Long-term Solutions:**
- Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms for MQTT.
- Use TLS encryption to secure data in transit.
- Update MQTT software and libraries to address known vulnerabilities.

**Best Practices:**
- Implement email or message filtering to detect and block phishing attempts.
- Train employees to recognize and avoid phishing emails.
- Maintain secure network infrastructure and access controls.
