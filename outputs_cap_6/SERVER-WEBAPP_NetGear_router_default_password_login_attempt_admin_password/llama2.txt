Assess Potential Impact:
If left unaddressed, this alert could indicate a successful phishing attack, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data, such as login credentials or other valuable information. This could result in financial losses, reputational damage, and legal consequences for the organization.

Recommend Mitigation Steps:

* Immediate Action: Block the IP address and investigate the source of the login attempt to determine if it was a legitimate attempt or a phishing attack.
* Long-term Solution: Implement email filtering to detect and prevent phishing attempts, as well as educate employees on recognizing phishing emails and best practices for password security.
* Best Practice: Use strong, unique passwords for all accounts, and consider implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) to add an additional layer of security.
